# Draw Stimuli
## Under construction - to add more details
`Bonvision` comes with a set of operators/primitives to draw basic shapes, display images and video, render common visual neuroscience stimuli, and display complex scenes and 3d models.

The starting point to test these out is a basic workflow (which was covered in the overview section)

## Images and video primitives
In order to display images and videos, they have to be first loaded as a resource during the `Create Section` portion of the workflow using the `Texture Resources` operator.

We can then use these primitives to load images and videos.
