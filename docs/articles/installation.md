# Installation

Install Bonsai from [www.bonsai-rx.org](https://www.bonsai-rx.org). 

Once you open Bonsai, choose 'Manage Packages' and add additional packages:
* Starter Pack
* BonVision - you can find this by navigating to `Package Source` -> `Community Packages`

BonVision has the same requirements as Bonsai: .NET framework on Windows 7 or later.
