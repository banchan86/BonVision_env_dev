BonVision is developed by the [Saleem Lab](https://www.saleemlab.com/) & [Solomon Lab](https://solomonlab.info/) at the UCL Institute of Behavioural Neuroscience in collaboration with [NeuroGEARS](https://neurogears.org/).

BonVision’s key features include:

- Naturally closed-loop system based on reactive coding of the Bonsai framework
- Handles 2D and 3D stimuli with equal ease
- Visual environment generated independent of display configuration
- Graphical programming language of the Bonsai framework
- Can be used for Augmented Reality, Virtual Reality or 2D visual stimuli
- Does not require the observer to be in a fixed position

Creating a stimulus is as simple as shown in this animation, where stimuli can be designed by using various nodes in the program. 
The details of how to build stimuli are described in the section ‘Getting Started’.
