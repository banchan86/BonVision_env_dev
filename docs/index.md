# BonVision - Making Visual Environments
BonVision is an open-source closed-loop visual environment generator developed by the [Saleem Lab](www.saleemlab.com) and [Solomon Lab](www.solomonlab.info) at the UCL Institute of Behavioural Neuroscience in collaboration with [NeuroGEARS](https://neurogears.org/).

BonVisionâ€™s key features include:

- Naturally closed-loop system based on reactive coding of the Bonsai framework
- Handles 2D and 3D stimuli with equal ease
- Visual environment generated independent of display configuration
- Graphical programming language of the Bonsai framework
- Can be used for Augmented Reality, Virtual Reality or 2D visual stimuli
- Does not require the observer to be in a fixed position
